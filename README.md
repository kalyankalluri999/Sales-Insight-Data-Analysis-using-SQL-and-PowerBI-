â€¢	Understood the business problem statement (all sales transactions, customer data, product data, market data are stored in the MySQL database).

Used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to investigate the data and PowerBI for ETL and Visualizations to create the insights dashboard. After analysing this database, I connected it to Power BI. I use ETL and data cleaning processes in Power BI to get the data ready to build dashboard. Then created a robust dashboard that will enable us to get sales key insights.
